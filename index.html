<p>Scampi is a one year old, 13 lb, terrier mix. I adopted him in August 2024 through the rescue organization <a href="https://heartsandbonesrescue.org/">Hearts and Bones</a>. I met him when he got off the van that transported him from Texas to New York City. At first he was a foster dog, and then I adopted him. The first week he was home with me he got very sick and had to go to the vet. He had pneumonia. With a lot of antibiotics and rest he recovered and became extremely active and happy. He is very friendly and wants to meet every person and dog he sees. He will roll over for a belly rub from anyone and loves  bones. Adopting Scampi has been a great experience and I encourage anyone who wants a pet to go through the adoption process, there are a lot of pets that need homes.</p>
