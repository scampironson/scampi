<p>The rescue that I worked with, <a href="https://heartsandbonesrescue.org/">Hearts and Bones</a>, takes dogs from shelters in Texas and transports them to New York. They do not have shelter facilities in New York so they place all the dogs in foster homes when they first arrive. The organization offers a a 5 day trial run with a dog to see if it is a fit, called foster-to-adopt. It is an opportunity to expereince a dog in your home before committing to adoption.</p> 
<p>It can be overwhelming to adopt a dog especially when they are new to the city. The opportunity to spend quality time with a dog before adopting gives you time to decide if it's the right fit. Fostering also helps the rescue organization increase the amount of dogs they are able to take care of. The dogs benefit from being able to leave a shelter and be in a loving environment. Even if the dog does not become a permanent companion the experience can be life changing. </p>
