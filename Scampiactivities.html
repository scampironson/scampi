<h1 id="blue">Scampi’s Favorite Brooklyn Activities</h1>
<h2 id="red">(So far)</h2>
<ul class="outer-list"> 
  <li>Herbert Von King Dog Park
  <ul>
    <li>Scampi loves getting all of the other dogs to run around and chase him. He is not afraid of getting knocked around a little</li>
    <li>He would love to visit everyday</li>
    <li>Because the ground is loose dirt and wood chips he gets dirty immediately and usually needs a bath after visiting</li>
  </ul>
</li>
  <li>Fort Greene Farmers market
    <ul>
    <li>There are a lot of people and dogs to meet </li>
    <li>Scampi can sometimes get a little overwhelmed by all the smells and the crowd, but with breaks to rest he does really well</li>
  </ul>
</li>
  <li>Visiting the dry cleaner
  <ul>
    <li>No one working there has ever given Scampi a treat or pet him, but he always gets s excited when we walk by, and wants to go in</li>
  </ul>
</li>
  <li>Saying hi at <a href="https://www.wydbk.com/">Who's Your Doggy</a>
<ul>
  <li>This is our local pet store and they have a great stock of supplies, toys and treats, as well as offering grooming services</li> 
  <li>Scampi always gets treats and pets when we go here</li>
  <li>It can be hard to get him to leave when we are done</li>
</ul>
  <li>Going to the vet
  <ul>
    <li>Most dogs are afraid of the vet, but Scampi gets a lot of attention and unlimited treats from the vet and their staff</li>
    <li>He is so excited the whole time we are there I don’t think he even realizes when he gets shots</li>
  </ul>
</li>
  <li>Getting tacos at Chilo’s
  <ul>
    <li>Scampi did not get to eat any tacos, so maybe this wasn’t really his favorite activity, but I had fun</li>
    <li>He was able to lay on the floor and be calm while I enjoyed my taco and margarita </li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
